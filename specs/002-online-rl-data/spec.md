# Feature Specification: AIOpsLab Task Execution API

**Feature Branch**: `002-online-rl-data`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "online rl data api, we're going to build a restful api for feed online RL traning, with the operations of what AIOpsLbas does; behind the restful api, it should support schedule more than one Orchetrator with multiple kind banckedn ( 1 - 1 mappping) instance for scalaability. and it should create new session with any avaibale id;"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of AIOpsLab, I need to submit tasks via RESTful API to execute specific AIOpsLab problems (like running `python3 clients/gpt.py`), have these tasks queued in a database for processing by available workers, and retrieve results once tasks are completed, enabling scalable execution across multiple independent worker instances.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a running system with available workers, **When** a user submits a new task request via API, **Then** the system creates a new task with unique identifier and stores it in database queue
2. **Given** multiple workers with different backend types, **When** a user requests a specific backend type, **Then** the system ensures task is picked up by worker with matching backend
3. **Given** all workers are busy, **When** a new task request arrives, **Then** the system stores the task in database queue for workers to poll and execute when available
4. **Given** an active task execution, **When** the worker processes the AIOpsLab problem, **Then** the task status is updated to running and progress is tracked
5. **Given** multiple concurrent tasks, **When** workers process them, **Then** each task maintains isolation through separate Kind clusters
6. **Given** a completed task, **When** the user queries for results, **Then** the system returns execution logs, metrics, and outcomes from database
7. **Given** a worker failure during task execution, **When** the failure is detected, **Then** the system marks the task as failed, logs the error details, and stores the failure information in the database

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no workers are available? Tasks remain in pending state in database queue until workers become available
- How does system handle invalid or malformed JSON submission? System returns validation error without creating task
- What happens when a worker/backend becomes unavailable mid-task? Task is marked as failed with error details stored in database
- How does the system behave when task creation is requested but no workers are configured? Task is created in pending state and waits for workers
- What happens when a task exceeds 30-minute timeout? Task is marked as failed with timeout error
- How does system handle worker crashes? Tasks assigned to crashed workers timeout after 30 minutes and are marked as failed

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide RESTful API endpoints for submitting AIOpsLab task execution requests
- **FR-002**: System MUST support creation of new tasks with unique identifiers
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow scheduling and management of multiple orchestrator instances
- **FR-004**: System MUST support different backend types with one-to-one mapping to orchestrators
- **FR-005**: System MUST distribute task workload across available workers for scalability
- **FR-006**: System MUST execute AIOpsLab tasks (similar to running `python3 clients/gpt.py`) through RESTful API endpoints
- **FR-007**: System MUST use worker-task pattern where workers poll database for new tasks and execute them with their own orchestrator and kind cluster
- **FR-008**: System MUST track task states (pending, running, completed, failed) with 30-minute timeout for running tasks
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle concurrent requests from multiple users
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide task status query endpoints to check task state, results, and error information
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate JSON request format with required field 'problem_id' and optional fields (agent_config, max_steps, timeout_minutes, callback_url, metadata, priority)
- **FR-012**: System MUST identify workers by their kind cluster names to ensure proper task assignment and isolation
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide data retrieval for completed tasks
- **FR-014**: System MUST ensure data isolation between different tasks
- **FR-015**: System MUST operate without authentication/authorization mechanisms (no AUTH required)
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle backend failures by marking tasks as failed and storing error details in database
- **FR-017**: System MUST permanently store all task data and results in database without deletion
- **FR-018**: Workers MUST periodically poll database to fetch pending tasks for execution
- **FR-019**: System MUST update task status from pending to running when worker picks up task
- **FR-020**: System MUST store task execution logs and results in database upon completion or failure

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Task**: Represents an AIOpsLab problem execution request with unique identifier, status (pending/running/completed/failed), problem_id, creation timestamp, and execution parameters
- **Worker**: Independent processing unit that polls database for tasks, each with its own Orchestrator and Kind cluster, identified by cluster name
- **Task Queue**: Database table storing pending tasks waiting for worker processing
- **Task Result**: Output from completed tasks including execution logs, metrics, error details, and completion timestamp
- **Task Request**: Initial API request containing problem_id (required) and optional parameters (agent_config, max_steps, timeout_minutes, callback_url, metadata, priority)
